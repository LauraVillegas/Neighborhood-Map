# Downloading and (~~Lunching~~) Launching
* To start you must first download the source files from this repo or by enterering `clone` from your terminal.
* Run npm install/ npm start from your terminal
* Start browsing <3

#### This is some helpful info the folks at Udacity have provided us to get started:

##### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## My Story:

I started learning web development on my own about three years ago. At the time I was working on a call center and really didn't know what I was gonna be good at.
Long story short and fast forward I have Learned so much with Udacity that now I have my first dev job in which I make 60k to start. I can't explain how grateful I am with Udacity and GWG scholarship for providing me with this oportunity. The new job I started as a dev consists on developing sharepoint sites and the learning curve has been inredible. Hence why I am submitting this project at the very last minute. I just want you all to know that each and everyone of you at Udacity really made the difference and helped me push through making it through this long road.

### THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!
